Blacklisted Assets

The array below contains classnames of assets which are not allowed to be sold within Antistasi.
Reason for this is that those items are one or more of the following:
- can be aquired by means that don't cost anything and the ability to sell those would be an infinite money exploit.
- are no proper "statics" in terms of weaponized statics but for example the ACE spotting scoped
- something else
